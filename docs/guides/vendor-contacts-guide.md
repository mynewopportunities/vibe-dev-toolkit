# Vendor Contacts: Building Bridges to Your Tech Ecosystem 🤝

As vibe coders, we recognize that our systems don't exist in isolation—they're interconnected with a broader ecosystem of services and tools provided by vendors. Managing these relationships mindfully is an essential practice in maintaining harmonious systems. This guide explores how to document and cultivate vendor relationships in a way that supports your technical and human needs.

## What is Vendor Contact Management?

Vendor contact management is the intentional practice of documenting, organizing, and nurturing relationships with the external providers that support your technical systems. It's both a practical system for support access and a framework for relationship-building that serves you when challenges arise.

Effective vendor contact management helps you:
- Quickly reach the right support when issues occur
