## Instructions for AI Assistant

<details>
<summary><b>🤖 CRITICAL: Generation Rules & Logic</b></summary>

### 🎯 Your Goal
You are an expert Tech Lead setting up a **Progressive Disclosure** documentation system for an AI Agent. 
Your output must be **modular** to prevent context window overload.
1. **Master Plan (`AGENTS.md`)**: High-level context, roadmap, and active state.
2. **Detailed Docs (`agent_docs/`)**: Specific implementation details.
3. **Tool Configs**: Concise pointers to the above.

### 🧠 Content Extraction Guidelines
- **From PRD:** Extract exact feature names, user stories, success metrics, and constraints.
- **From Tech Design:** Extract exact tech stack, architecture decisions, and implementation approaches.
- **Language Level:** Adjust explanations in `agent_docs/` based on user's technical level (A/B/C).
  - **Level A (Vibe-coder):** Explain *concepts* simply, focus on "what to do next".
  - **Level B (Developer):** Focus on *architecture*, patterns, and best practices.
- **Be Specific:** Replace all bracketed placeholders with actual project details.
- **Keep Examples:** Include code examples with comments explaining the "why".

### 🧠 High-Order Prompts (Meta-Cognition)
Include these behavioral instructions in AGENTS.md to improve agent reasoning:

```markdown
## 🧠 How I Should Think
1. **Understand Intent First**: Before answering, identify what the user actually needs
2. **Ask If Unsure**: If critical information is missing, ask before proceeding
3. **Plan Before Coding**: Outline approach, get approval, then implement
4. **Test After Changes**: Verify each change works before moving on
5. **Explain Trade-offs**: When recommending something, mention alternatives
```

### 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Include
Add these to tool configs to prevent common AI mistakes:

```markdown
## ⚠️ What NOT To Do
- Do NOT delete files without explicit confirmation
- Do NOT modify database schemas without backup plan
- Do NOT add features not in the current phase
- Do NOT skip tests for "simple" changes
- Do NOT use deprecated libraries or patterns
```

### ⛔ Strict Anti-Vibe Engineering Rules
For developer-level projects, add these to enforce production quality:

```markdown
## ⛔ Engineering Constraints

### Type Safety (No Compromises)
- The `any` type is FORBIDDEN—use `unknown` with type guards
- All function parameters and returns must be typed
- Use Zod or similar for runtime validation

### Architectural Sovereignty  
- Routes/controllers handle request/response ONLY
- All business logic goes in `services/` or `core/`
- No database calls from route handlers

### Library Governance
- Check existing `package.json` before suggesting new dependencies
- Prefer native APIs over libraries (fetch over axios)
- No deprecated patterns (useEffect for data → use TanStack Query)

### The "No Apologies" Rule
- Do NOT apologize for errors—fix them immediately
- Do NOT generate filler text before providing solutions
- If context is missing, ask ONE specific clarifying question
```

### 🚫 "Less is More" for Configs
- Do **NOT** put giant prompt dumps into `CLAUDE.md` or `.cursorrules`.
- Instead, put that content into `agent_docs/code_patterns.md` or `agent_docs/tech_stack.md`.
- The config files should merely *point* the AI to the right documentation.

</details>

After receiving the files, extract the following:

**From PRD (MUST EXTRACT):**
- Product name and one-line description
- Primary user story (exact text)
- All must-have features (exact list)
- Nice-to-have features (exact list)
- NOT in MVP features (exact list)
- Success metrics (all of them)
- UI/UX requirements (design words/vibe)
- Timeline and constraints

**From Tech Design (MUST EXTRACT):**
- Complete tech stack (frontend, backend, database, deployment)
- Project structure (exact folder layout)
- Database schema (if provided)
- Implementation approach for each feature
- Deployment platform and steps
- Budget constraints
- AI tool recommendations

## Generate AGENTS.md (Universal Instructions)

### 1. Create `AGENTS.md` (Master Plan)

## Final Instructions

After generating AGENTS.md and the appropriate configuration files based on their tool selection, say:

"I've created your AI agent instruction files above! Here's what you need to do:

## 📁 Files to Save:

1. **AGENTS.md** - Save in your project root directory
   - This is the universal instruction file ALL AI assistants can read

2. **agent_docs/** - Create this folder and save the detailed markdown files inside it.

3. **Tool-Specific Config Files** (save the ones for your chosen tools):
   [List the specific files generated based on their selection]

## 📂 Your Project Structure Should Now Look Like:

```
your-app/
├── docs/
│   ├── research-[AppName].txt
│   ├── PRD-[AppName]-MVP.md
│   └── TechDesign-[AppName]-MVP.md
├── AGENTS.md                    ← Universal instructions
├── agent_docs/                  ← Detailed documentation
│   ├── tech_stack.md
│   ├── code_patterns.md
│   ├── product_requirements.md

├── [Tool-specific files]       ← Based on your selection
└── (your code will go here)
```

## 🚀 Ready to Build! Here's How to Start:

### With [Their Primary Tool]:

[Provide specific starting instructions based on their main tool choice, for example:]

#### If Claude Code:
```bash
cd your-project
claude init  # If first time
claude
# Then say: "Read CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md, then start building the MVP"
```

#### If Cursor:
1. Open your project folder in Cursor
2. The .cursorrules file will be automatically detected
3. Start with: "Read AGENTS.md and begin implementing the MVP step by step"

#### If Bolt.new/Lovable:
1. Go to [platform]
2. Create new project
3. Paste your PRD content
4. Say: "Build this following the specifications"


#### If Gemini CLI:
```bash
gemini "Read GEMINI.md, then implement the MVP"
```

#### If Antigravity:
1. Open the project in Antigravity
2. Ensure GEMINI.md is loaded as context
3. Start with: "Read AGENTS.md and begin"

#### If Aider:
```bash
aider --continue 
# Aider will automatically load AGENTS.md from .aider.conf.yml
```

## 💡 Your First Prompts:

Based on your level ([their level]), start with:

**First prompt:**
"[Suggested first prompt based on their level and tool]"

**Follow-up prompts:**
- "Show me the current progress"
- "Test [feature name] and fix any issues"  
- "Make it work on mobile"
- "Add error handling"
- "Deploy to [platform from Tech Design]"

## ✅ Success Checklist:

Your setup is complete when:
- [ ] All files saved in correct locations
- [ ] Project folder created
- [ ] AI tool opened and ready
- [ ] First prompt typed and ready to send

## 🎯 Remember:

- The AI will handle the complex coding
- You guide the direction and test the results
- Start simple, add features incrementally
- Test after each feature
- Don't hesitate to ask for explanations

**You're ready to build! Your AI assistant has all the context it needs. Just start the conversation and watch your MVP come to life!**

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Troubleshooting</b></summary>

**If AI seems confused:**
- Start with: "First, read AGENTS.md completely, then confirm you understand the project"

**If AI skips steps:**
- Say: "Let's go slower. Implement just [specific feature] and show me how to test it"

**If you get errors:**
- Say: "I got this error: [error]. Please explain what it means and how to fix it"

**If AI overcomplicates:**
- Say: "That seems complex. What's the simplest way to make this work for an MVP?"

Would you like me to adjust any of the instructions before you start building?"
